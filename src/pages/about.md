I’m a data scientist and design enthusiast who loves to build and code. I strongly believe in maintaining a high standard for product quality, and I recognize that gaining a deep understanding of constraints is crucial elevating product quality. 

I love engaging with technical communites and I’m passionate about commradiere. I know that successful products are collaborative endeavors spanning research, engineering, product, design and more. 

I obsess about the details and strive for excellence - not perfection. I believe in focusing on the process and refining the finer details. Results will always follow. I spend a lot of time on the intangible parts of a product, like [](https://twitter.com/Stammy/status/1364261677898870785)research and product strategy, to help focus teams and evangelize the direction. I enjoy documentation and [content creation](https://noassembly.ghost.io/) as well.

I am currently building [No Assembly](https://noassembly.ghost.io/), an ambitious and exciting project. No Assembly’s overarching mission is to democratize machine learning through open education and to encourage diverse perspectives in AI, through other engaging and insightful content. It is a community of learners, builders, enthusiasts, policy makers and industry professionals working together to leverage this trasformative technology for the long term good of humanity. It’s a project I’m building in public. If you have some ideas to support this mission and you’d like to get involved, please reach out via the contact page on the No Assembly website. You can view the project roadmap [here](https://noassembly.ghost.io/about/). 

You can find me on Twitter (@milanoi_) where I like to talk about tech, No Assembly and just generally things that interest me.
